Task Description: Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering
Objective
Implement a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

Dataset
Use the "Customer Segmentation" dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains information about customers' annual income and spending score.

Steps to Implement the Model
Load and Explore the Data

Load the dataset using pandas.
Explore the columns and understand the structure of the data.
Data Preprocessing

Depending on the dataset, perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling the data, or encoding categorical variables (if any).
Implement K-means Clustering

Initialize the K-means clustering algorithm using scikit-learn's KMeans.
Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using methods like the elbow method or silhouette score.
Fit the Model

Fit the K-means model to the preprocessed data.
Visualize Clusters

Visualize the clusters to understand how customers are segmented based on their purchase behavior.
Interpret the Results

Analyze and interpret the clusters to gain insights into different customer segments and their characteristics.
